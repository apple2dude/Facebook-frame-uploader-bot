# Facebook-frame-uploader-bot

This project is for uploading frames of tv shows, cartoons, whatever images you want really, to Facebook in a timed and ordered way. Frames need to be named sequentially 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, etc. for this to work, and also need to be placed in a folder titled "Episode X" where X is some number. Everything else should be pretty self explanatory with the comments in the code

I initially based this off of the code that originally ran the Every Tom and Jerry Frame In Order page, but have made lots of changes since I first adapted it last fall. If the Facebook API changes I'll likely update the code, as I have two pages (Every Magic School Bus Frame In Order and Every Gravity Falls Frame In Order) running off it.

The code is set up so that if the program crashes for whatever reason (happens to me a lot because my internet sucks), you can just double click on the .py and have it start right where it left off.
